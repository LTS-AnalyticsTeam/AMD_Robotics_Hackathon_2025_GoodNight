## Summary:
This robot gently tucks a blanket over a plush toy or a person using its two arms.
It can place, adjust, and smooth the blanket to provide comfort and warmth on a cold night.
Through this project, we aim to bring a sense of kindness and emotional warmth to machines that are often perceived as mechanical and impersonal.

### Problems We Aim to Solve
Rather than focusing solely on functional automation, this product explores how robots can offer emotional support and enhance everyday life. It addresses several real-world needs:

- Providing a sense of comfort and companionship for those who sleep alone
- Maintaining a comfortable sleeping environment by adjusting the blanket during the night
- Supporting children, elderly individuals, or anyone who may have difficulty managing a blanket by themselves

Our goal is not just to move a piece of fabric, but to create a robot that genuinely cares for human well-being.

### Technical Challenges
Achieving this seemingly simple interaction required tackling several difficult technical problems:

- Coordinated control of a dual-arm system to lift, spread, and position the blanket
- Manipulation of deformable materials, which have unpredictable shapes and dynamics
- Designing motion profiles that express gentleness through speed, force, and movement patterns

By addressing these challenges, we explore how robots can perform delicate tasks that reflect warmth and empathy in human care.
